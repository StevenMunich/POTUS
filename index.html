<h3>1/20/21</h3>
	<p>On this day senator palpatine was sworn into the white house. For hours the musicians played star wars music to give him a warm welcome. Ashamed of his son Hunter he made up the story about another son, named boue. "he served his country" are the words our new president spoke to make it seem like his child died in a war. Republicans are hoping for a long and prosperous presidency because if he dies then a large black woman will be president.</p>
